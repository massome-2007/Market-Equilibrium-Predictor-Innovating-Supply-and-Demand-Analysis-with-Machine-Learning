# Market Equilibrium Predictor: Innovating Supply and Demand Analysis with Machine Learning

Project Overview:
We'll simulate supply and demand data, then train a machine learning model to predict the equilibrium price and quantity for a given product. This will provide insights into how market dynamics might evolve in the future.

Explanation:
Simulating Supply and Demand Data: Generated random data to simulate supply and demand curves.

Feature and Target Variables: Defined price as the feature and quantities as target variables.

Model Training: Trained linear regression models for both demand and supply using the simulated data.

Equilibrium Prediction: Predicted demand and supply quantities for test set prices, then found the equilibrium price and quantity where the predicted demand equals predicted supply.

Visualization: Plotted the simulated data, predicted demand and supply curves, and highlighted the equilibrium price and quantity.

Key Features:
Simulated Data: Created hypothetical supply and demand data to model future market conditions.

Linear Regression: Used simple linear regression models to predict demand and supply.

Equilibrium Prediction: Identified the market equilibrium where demand equals supply.

Visualization: Provided a clear visual representation of the supply and demand curves and equilibrium point.
